# Basic-webshop

I build this webshop for a final assessment for my Web222 class at Seneca College. This was the first web project I made at Seneca, so the functionality is limited.

It uses the following:
* HTML
* Javascript
* CSS

# Functionality
The assignment called for us to create a webshop that would display various products. I chose old cameras and film because analog photography is an interest of mine.
The website displays a number of products that are either cameras, lenses, or film. The product information is pulled from an array of objects and displayed on the website.
There is a subscribe form present at the bottom of the page and javascript is used to validate the email that is input.
